# project-euler
Scripts and functions that solve Project Euler challenges in math and computer science.

Many of these problems have been on the Internet for over a decade, so the solutions are readily available. I want to caution any users, though, if you use these scripts to obtain an answer, it's just the same as if you copied the solution of a crossword puzzle. I enjoyed solving these problems. Don't deny yourself that same joy of overcoming a challenge.

This is a bit of a problem to sharpen formatting and re-factoring skills, so I shoot for complete PEP-8 compliance and clear, concise code, even for rather elemental problems.

Feel free to contact me through GitHub if you have any questions.
