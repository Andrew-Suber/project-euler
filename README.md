# project-euler
Scripts and functions that solve Project Euler challenges in math and computer science.

Many of these problems have been on the Internet for over a decade, so the solutions are readily available. I want to caution any users, though, if you use these scripts, or another Internet resource, to obtain an answer, it's just the same as if you copied the solution of a crossword puzzle. I enjoyed solving these problems. Don't deny yourself that same joy of overcoming a challenge.

This is an exercise to sharpen formatting and re-factoring skills. It also lets me practice with Vim, Pylint, Pytest and Git in a fun way that presents my math skills. I shoot for complete PEP-8 compliance and clean, concise, well-commented codes, logs and notes.

My current goal is to make a significant commit to my GitHub repo every day.
